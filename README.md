# lazylangs.nvim

lazylangs.nvim is a tool made to simplify setting up tools for programming
languages by centralizing all tooling configuration into one place. It
integrates with existing plugins and uses their configuration methods whenever
possible. A selection of pre-made language configurations are included, though
for any language you are programming in often you will likely want to override
it to tailor it to your tastes.
