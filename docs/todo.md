# Contributing and TODOs

## Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome. These may be a PR to implement a
feature or just suggestions regarding features or improvements. If you find an
issue with one of the included language configs or have a thought on how to
make it better, feel free to open an issue. Feel free to open issues if there
is a certain plugin you'd like integrations with as well.
